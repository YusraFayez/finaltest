   <p>Having started way back in 1870 in Naples,<br> it’s no wonder this cult-status pizza chain has spread like wildfire across the world – prices are reasonable,<br>the pizzas are served up relatively quickly, and the quality is superb.<br> Oozing rustic charm with plants hanging like chandeliers<br> wicker baskets like lampshades and mismatched plates and chairs,<br> as well as absolutely stellar service that always comes with a smile<br> it’s a win/win on all parts, but particularly for the thin based pizzas<br> that include all the classics as well as tartufo,<br> burrata and bresaola. Simple yet effective, just how we like it.</p>
